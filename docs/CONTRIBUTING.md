You can contribute to SensAI in many ways:

## Contributing Code
1. You can contribute by adding new features or fixing bugs. Set up the codebase locally on your system following the instructions in `docs/INSTALL.md`, check out our [public roadmap](https://hyperverge.notion.site/fa1dd0cef7194fa9bf95c28820dca57f?v=ec52c6a716e94df180dcc8ced3d87610), pick up tasks from the `Not Started` or `Backlog` sections and make a `Merge Request` (MR).
2. When you create an MR, please fill in the MR template that will be provided to you and adhere to the checklist to make sure the review process is efficient for everyone.
3. On the roadmap, there are specific features/tasks that have been tagged as ⁠`Research`. These are tasks which might need a lot more experimentation before they can be ready for prime time. For those of you interested to work on research problems, you can pick up any research problem that excites you.
4. You can also contribute your own ideas for interesting research problems we could potentially work on!

## Other ways to contribute
- `Add/improve documentation`: This is no less important than improving the library itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or if you feel that the readability of the code/documentation can be improved, do not hesitate to submit a pull request to the [Documentation repo](https://github.com/dalmia/sensai-docs).
- `Report issues`: Report issues you are facing either by [creating an issue](https://gitlab.com/hvacademy/sensai-ai/-/issues) or sharing it in our [community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmiulDbWpcXIgqNK6fZyxe), and give a "thumbs up" on issues reported by others that are relevant to you. 
- `Spread the word`: Reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it.
- `Provide feedback`: If you are a teacher or a non-profit, you can test SensAI with your learners and provide valuable feedback.
- `Learning engineering`: SensAI generates a lot of data on how learners are learning and growing in their journey. Analysing this data and uncovering insights will help us improve SensAI to better support our learners and teachers. If you are interested in this, do reach out to us on the community and we'll be happy to discuss this with you.
- `Engage with the community`: Join our [community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmiulDbWpcXIgqNK6fZyxe) of builders in AI + Education and ask any questions that you might have or engage in the discussions, helping other fellow contributors and sharing your ideas/thoughts.

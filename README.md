# SensAI backend

SensAI is an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) which enables educators to help them teacher smarter and reach further. SensAI coaches your students through questions that develop deeper thinking—just like you would, but for every student and all the time. This repository is the backend for SensAI. The frontend repository can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/hvacademy/sensai-frontend).

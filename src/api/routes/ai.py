You need to thoroughly analyse the reference material given to you and come up with a structure for the course. Each course should be structured into modules where each modules represents a full topic.

With each modules, there must be a mix of learning materials and quizzes. A learning material is used for learning about a specific concept in the topic. Keep separate learning materials for different concepts in the same topic/module. For each concept, the learning material for that concept should be followed by one or more quizzes. Each quiz contains multiple questions for testing the understanding of the learner on the actual concept.

Quizzes are where learners can practice a concept. While testing theoretical understanding is important, quizzes should go beyond that and produce practical challenges for the students to apply what they have learnt. If the reference material already has examples/sample problems, include them in the quizzes for the students to practice. If no examples are present in the reference material, generate a few relevant problem statements to test the real-world understanding of each concept for the students.

All explanations should be present in the learning materials and all practice should be done in quizzes. Maintain this separation of purpose for each task type.

No need to come up with the questions inside the quizzes for now. Just focus on producing the right structure.
Don't keep any concept too big. Break a topic down into multiple smaller, ideally independent, concepts. For each concept, follow the sequence of learning material -> quiz before moving to the next concept in that topic.
End the course with a conclusion module (with the appropriate name for the module suited to the course) which ties everything taught in the course together and ideally ends with a capstone project where the learner has to apply everything they have learnt in the course.

Make sure to never skip a single concept from the reference material provided.

The final output should be a JSON in the following format:

- For a quiz, each question must add a strong positive value to the overall learner's understanding. Do not unnecessarily add questions simply to increase the number of questions. If a quiz merits only a single question based on the reference material provided or your asseessment of how many questions are necessary for it, keep a single question itself. Only add multiple questions when the quiz merits so. 
- The `content` for each question is the only part of the question shown directly to the student. Add everything that the student needs to know to answer the question inside the `content` field for that question. Do not add anything there that should not be shown to the student (e.g. what is the correct answer). To add instructions for how the student should be given feedback or the overall purpose of that question or raw content from the reference material required as context to give adequate feedback, add it to the `context` field instead. 
- While testing theoretical understanding is important, a quiz should go beyond that and produce practical challenges for the students to apply what they have learnt. If the reference material already has examples/sample problems, include them in the a quiz for the students to practice. If no examples are present in the reference material, generate a few relevant problem statements to test the real-world understanding of each concept for the students.
- If a question references a set of options that must be shown to the student, always make sure that those options are actually present in the `content` field for that question. THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT. As mentioned before, if the reference material does not have the options or data required for the question, generate it based on your understanding of the question and its purpose.
- Use appropriate formatting for the `blocks` in each question. Make use of all the block types available to you to make the content of each question as engaging and readable as possible.
- Do not use the name of the quiz as a heading to mark the start of a question in the `blocks` field for each question. The name of the quiz will already be visible to the student."""
